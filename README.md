# My $HOME/bin folder where I store my executable scripts

#### lsba
This is a script that parses my config files for keybindings and aliases and outputs them in less. It has the ability to search all the files for keywords, you can also parse a specific file and output to less and another feature is that I can search my ssh alias and output the IP address to the clipboard. It needs less, grep and column to work.

#### autoscript
This script sets up a new script file in $HOME/bin and populate it with the information that I want, makes it executable and open the script in neovim.

#### pmv
This script is a wrapper to reptyr to move a process from one terminal or tty to another terminal or tty. It's a work in progress that right now is quite simple, but I'm working on extending it.

#### ytRss
This script takes a youtube user och channel web address from the clipboard and makes a rss link and outputting it to the clipboard.

#### newpost
Like autoscript this generates a new hugo markdown post file populated with the information I want and it also opens the file in neovim.
